// model - the "T" of ELT.
//
// A model is SQL, stored in an Apps Script .html file, read back at run
// time with HtmlService because .html is the only plain-text file Apps
// Script lets a project hold. Models reference each other dbt-style, with
// {{ ref('other_model') }} placeholders inside the SQL. Those refs *are*
// the dependency declaration - a model never hand-writes dependsOn for
// something its SQL already ref()s, and refs get substituted with the
// real table identifier just before the SQL runs. ref() resolves against
// two things: another declared model, or a move node whose target is
// bigquery (see the moveBigQueryTargets index in expandModelNodes()
// below) - a move node loading anything else (Sheets, Drive, an API) has
// no queryable relation for ref() to substitute, so a model that merely
// needs to wait on one of those still uses a hand-written dependsOn - see
// MODEL_DEFAULT_KEYS and mergeDependsOn() below, and docs/model.md's
// "Depending on a move node" for the user-facing version.
//
// {{ source('name', 'table') }} placeholders are a third, separate way to
// select from data outside the model itself - for a BigQuery table this
// project never loads or builds at all (owned by another team's own
// pipeline, Fivetran, BigQuery Data Transfer Service, ...), the case
// ref() structurally can't cover since ref() only ever resolves something
// this project is itself responsible for. Declared once, project-wide, as
// notsobigdataModels.sources (see readSourcesEntry() below) - dbt's
// source.yml equivalent. Unlike ref(), a source() call never derives a
// dependsOn edge: a source is never a node (see readSourcesEntry()'s own
// comment), so there's nothing for it to run before.
//
// A model's .html file can hold its SQL three ways, chosen by how many
// <script type="text/sql"> tags it contains - see extractModelSql() below:
//
//   - zero tags: the whole file is the SQL (nothing else in it to be).
//   - one tag: that tag's content is the SQL. It may carry an "id", but if
//     it does, the id must match the model name - same rule as the
//     several-tags case below, so a copy-pasted tag with a stale id fails
//     loudly instead of silently running under the wrong model.
//   - more than one tag: every model sharing that file gets its own
//     tagged block, and each tag needs an "id" matching a model name -
//     this is what makes "several small models in one .html file" work,
//     the way a single dbt project holds many .sql files.
//
// Every model is declared once, as an entry in a single shared registry -
// not as its own top-level "var" the way a move node is:
//
//   var notsobigdataModels = {
//     projectId: 'my-project', dataset: 'analytics', materialized: 'view',
//     models: {
//       stg_orders: { sqlFile: 'stg_orders.html' },
//       orders_summary: { sqlFile: 'orders_summary.html', materialized: 'table' }
//     }
//   };
//
// projectId/dataset/materialized at the top level are project-wide
// defaults; anything a model entry sets itself overrides them. sqlFile
// defaults to "<model name>.html" when omitted, same spirit as a node's
// own name defaulting from its variable elsewhere in this library.
//
// notsobigdataModels.folders is an optional second, narrower tier of
// defaults between the two above: a named group of config (any of the
// same keys a model entry could set) a model opts into with its own
// "folder: '<name>'", so several models sharing a dataset/materialized/
// sqlFile-prefix don't each repeat it. modelDir - one more registry/
// folder-level default key, alongside projectId/dataset/materialized/
// dependsOn - only ever changes what sqlFile's *default* expands to
// ("<modelDir><model name>.html"); a model with its own sqlFile ignores
// it. This is deliberately not dbt's model-paths: there is no directory
// scanning here (Apps Script's runtime has no API to list a project's
// own files, only exact-name fetch via HtmlService, so real discovery
// isn't buildable), and folder membership never affects a node's name or
// cli() selection - see docs/model.md's "Grouping models with folders"
// for the worked example.
//
// This is a deliberately different discovery shape than move's "every
// node is its own var": with dozens of models, N boilerplate top-level
// vars just to register them is worse than one object naming them all.
// The cost is that cli.js's discoverNodes() - which normally finds nodes
// by scanning the global scope for a "kind" key - cannot find these at
// all, since notsobigdataModels itself carries no "kind". expandModelNodes()
// below is the hook that makes up the difference: it turns the one
// registry into N fully-formed nodes, and discoverNodes() folds its
// output straight into the same list the var-scan produces. Selection,
// ordering and the run loop never learn the difference.

// Every {{ ... }} placeholder this library understands is a call - either
// ref()'s one positional string argument, config()'s kwarg-style
// key='value' arguments, or var()'s one-or-two positional string arguments
// (see parseSingleStringArgument, parseKwargsArgument and
// parseVarArguments below). Written as a generic scan-and-dispatch rather
// than a ref()-only regex, since more calls beyond the first were always
// expected: growing the dispatch in compileModelSql() below should stay an
// added case, not a rewrite of the scanner.
//
// {% set key = 'value' %} is deliberately a different bracket shape
// ({% %}, not {{ }}) - see setStatementPattern()/bareVarPattern() below -
// because it is a real Jinja *statement* (it defines a name, it doesn't
// evaluate to a substituted value itself), unlike every call this pattern
// matches, which stands in for the value it evaluates to.
//
// {% for x in [...] %}...{% endfor %} is a different, bigger construct
// still - a block, not a statement or a call - see
// forStatementOpenPattern()/expandForLoops() below. Unlike every other
// macro in this file, it doesn't join compileModelSql()'s dispatch at all:
// it's a text-expansion pass that runs once, at discovery time, before
// ref()/config()/set()/var() ever see the SQL, so a call inside a loop
// body is handled by the existing pipeline for free once the loop itself
// has been resolved into plain text.
//
// {{ name(args) }} calling a user-authored macro (declared with the
// {% macro %}/{% endmacro %} block construct, in a file notsobigdataModels.macros
// lists) is, like {% for %}, a text-expansion pass rather than a
// compileModelSql() dispatch case - see expandMacroCalls() below. It runs
// after {% for %} and before this scanner or compileModelSql() ever see the
// SQL, so ref()/config()/set()/var() living inside a macro's own body are
// handled by the existing pipeline for free, the same way a call inside a
// loop body already is.
//
// Matches the call *shape* only - name plus whatever sits between its
// parens - deliberately not either call's own stricter argument shape.
// Matching narrowly here would let a call this library doesn't recognize
// (a no-arg {{ macro() }}, some other kwarg-style call) fail to match at
// all and pass through as literal, unsubstituted text instead of being
// rejected by the "unsupported template call" check in compileModelSql()
// below - which defeats the point of that check. parseSingleStringArgument(),
// parseKwargsArgument() and parseVarArguments() below enforce each call's
// own stricter shape once a call is already known by name.

// resolveStagingTableId rather than growing a second staging-id helper -

// 2026-08-11, promotion itself also reuses move.js's promoteStagedTable()
// rather than a second hand-written copy job - see that function's own
// comment for why (a future BigQuery copy-job quirk, the kind
// widenDestinationTableForPromotion already was once, should only ever
// need fixing in one place).
//
// Promotion is a BigQuery *copy* job (configuration.copy,
// WRITE_TRUNCATE - a full replace, matching what CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
// already does every run since incremental materialization isn't
// implemented yet), not a second "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ... AS
// SELECT". That distinction is the whole point: an earlier version of
// this function's comment argued staging would double BigQuery compute,
// reasoning that promotion would mean re-running the model's own SELECT
// a second time. A copy job doesn't do that - it's a metadata-level
// operation, not a re-executed query - so the SELECT still runs exactly
// once per run, staging buys the "never test data that's already sitting
// in the real relation" guarantee for free, and the real relation is
// simply never touched by a run whose tests failed.
//
// The staging table's OPTIONS(expiration_timestamp=...) is set directly
// in the CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE DDL rather than via a separate
// BigQuery.Tables.insert call the way loadBigQueryStaged does - model()
// only ever talks to BigQuery through query jobs already (no CSV blob to
// load), so setting the expiration inline keeps this a single query job
// instead of adding a second API shape just for this one path.
