// The kind modules (move.js, model.js) are machinery for doing one step's
// work. This module is the declarative layer on top of them: instead of
// calling move() yourself, once per step, in the right order, you
// *declare* plain objects at the top level of your script and let cli()
// find them, order them by their dependencies, and run them. Same idea as
// dbt, where you don't call each model - you write models and run
// "dbt run --select ...".

// Maps a node's "kind" to the function that executes one node's config.
// This is the only place a kind is registered for *execution*: selection,
// ordering and the run loop below are all kind-agnostic, and knownKinds()
// feeds the help text, the selector errors and hello(), so all of those
// pick up a new kind from this map alone.
//
// One honest caveat, so nobody discovers it mid-change: discovery is
// kind-agnostic only for kinds whose *edges* are hand-written. move's
// dependsOn is read straight off its config below; model's isn't - a
// model derives its edges by parsing {{ ref() }} out of its own SQL, and
// its nodes don't even come from a top-level var each (see
// discoverNodes() below) - they're expanded from the single
// notsobigdataModels registry by model.js's expandModelNodes(). Both of
// those are model-specific hooks, kept as narrow as the kind that needed
// them; a third kind needing something similar gets its own hook, not a
// generalized version of this one.
